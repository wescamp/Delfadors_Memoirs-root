The 'Delfador's Memoirs' campaign was brought to you by:

Josh Parsons : creator of earlier versions (up to 0.5.2) of the campaign containg first 10 scenarios 

Oto 'tapik' Buchta : new maintainer (from 0.6.0), internationalization, improvements, bugfixing
 
Arkadiusz D. Danilecki : many things have been stolen from his 'A New Order'

The author of the initial scenarios had some ideas and in the future they will be fulfilled. If you would like to help me with the finalization, you could. Please contact me at the Wesnoth forum.
