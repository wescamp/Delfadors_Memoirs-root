The 'Delfador's Memoirs' campaign was brought to you by:

Josh Parsons : creator of earlier versions (up to 0.5.2) of the campaign containg first 10 scenarios 

Oto 'tapik' Buchta : new maintainer (from 0.6.0), internationalization, improvements, bugfixing

Sirp : Valley of Statues is adapted from a scenario he wrote for the original
Heir To The Throne, later removed to cut the length of that campaign.

Arkadiusz D. Danilecki : many things have been stolen from his 'A New Order'

Many thanks to Torangan for patience and explaining how wescamp works; all others from wesnoth forum.

            story=_ " CAMPAIGN MAINTAINER: The campaign is not finalized yet. Delfador should come to Abez with Chantal, kill the prince Eldred and many others. The author of the initial scenarios had some ideas and in the future they will be fulfilled. If you would like to help me with the finalization, you could. Please contact me at the Wesnoth forum.
